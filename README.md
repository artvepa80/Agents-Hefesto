## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the free tier really free forever?
Yes! The free tier includes 1 repository, 50K LOC/month, and basic code quality checks. No credit card required.

### What happens after my 14-day trial?
Your trial converts to a paid Professional subscription at $99/month (or $59/month if you're a Founding Member). Cancel anytime during the trial with no charges.

### Is the Founding Member price really locked forever?
Absolutely! The first 25 teams pay $59/month forever, even when we raise prices for new customers. This is our way of thanking early adopters.

### Can I switch from monthly to annual?
Yes! Contact support@narapallc.com and we'll help you upgrade with a prorated credit.

### What if I exceed my limits?
We'll notify you with a 7-day grace period. You can add expansion packs ($29 for +25 repos or $19 for +250K LOC) or contact us for custom limits.

### Do I pay for infrastructure costs?
You use your own BigQuery project and Gemini API key. Typical costs are $5-20/month for small teams - you pay Google directly for compute.

### How do I cancel?
